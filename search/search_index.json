Two-phase commit is the anti-availability protocol.\"</p> <p>Pat Helland</p> <p>In distributed systems, defining consistency boundaries is crucial for balancing performance and correctness. These boundaries determine where strong consistency is enforced and where eventual consistency is acceptable. Interestingly, tailoring these boundaries often requires business-driven decisions. For instance, while financial transactions demand strict consistency, less critical processes like reporting can tolerate delays.</p> <p>By explicitly defining consistency boundaries, you ensure the system aligns with business needs while optimizing scalability. This approach prevents over-engineering and allows the system to scale efficiently without unnecessary constraints.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the context of scalability, distribution and consistency, it is also worth mentioning conflict-free replicated data  types (CRDTs). CRDTs enable concurrent updates by multiple nodes without requiring centralized conflict resolution.  This reduces the need for managing atomic operations in distributed systems. By leveraging CRDTs, consistency can be  tailored to prioritize availability and eventual alignment, making them an effective choice for scenarios where  strict consistency boundaries are not critical.</p>"},{"location":"challenges/#time-travel","title":"Time Travel","text":"<p>When using CQRS with eventually consistent read models or state projections in CEQS, the system's state projections may reflect different points in  time due to the delay in propagating updates. This allows for a form of \"time travel,\" where users can observe data at  various stages of consistency. As new events are processed, the state projection gradually \"catches up\" with the latest state.  However, during this period, the system might expose outdated or future-looking states, effectively letting users or  systems \"travel\" between these states.</p> <p>This is particularly significant when querying or presenting data that spans multiple sources or services across  consistency boundaries. For example, one source might reflect an older version of the data, while another presents the  most recent state.</p> <p>As a result, combining data from these sources may yield conflicting or incoherent views of the overall system. This  inconsistency poses a challenge when trying to form a unified or accurate perspective of the current state. To mitigate  these issues, designers need to carefully consider the timing and aggregation of data to avoid misleading or  inconsistent results, especially in cases where decisions are being made based on these state projections.</p> <p>Avoiding Loops to Prevent Time Travel</p> <p>One common source of time travel issues in distributed systems is the presence of loops in the architecture. Feedback loops between services can introduce subtle timing problems, cause race conditions and lead to eventual consistency violations. These loops make it difficult to reason about the state of the system at any given point and often result in unexpected behavior.</p> <p>Loops can cause components to observe partial or out-of-date information or even see future state due to out-of-order event delivery. This breaks the mental model of cause and effect and undermines the reliability of event-driven workflows.</p> <p>In general, it's best to design systems using simple acyclic data flows. Unidirectional flows are easier to understand, test and scale. If a feedback mechanism is absolutely necessary, it should be isolated, tightly controlled and made idempotent to avoid cascading inconsistencies.</p> <p>Example: Cross-Entity Uniqueness</p> <p>A typical example of a loop arises when implementing cross-entity uniqueness constraints. For instance, a user might have a unique user ID but also an email address that must be globally unique. Enforcing email uniqueness can easily introduce a loop:</p> <ul> <li>The email registry needs to know which user currently owns the address</li> <li>The user entity may need confirmation that the email is available</li> <li>Race conditions occur if two users try to claim the same address at the same time</li> </ul> <p>To handle this safely, you need a clear protocol to reserve, update and release the email address. This should be done through a dedicated coordination service or component that serializes access to the shared constraint, avoiding circular dependencies between user entities.</p> <p>Avoiding loops is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce complexity and improve consistency in scalable systems.</p>"},{"location":"components/","title":"Components","text":""},{"location":"components/#components","title":"Components","text":"<p>Scalable Modeling uses the following components to model scalable systems.</p> <ul> <li>Components</li> <li>Bounded Contexts</li> <li>Events</li> <li>Ubiquitous Language</li> <li>Commands and State</li> <li>Queries</li> <li>Policies<ul> <li>Gatekeeper</li> <li>Command Handler</li> <li>Event Handler</li> <li>Query Handler</li> <li>Data Aggregator</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hotspots and Descriptions</li> <li>Consistency Boundaries</li> </ul>"},{"location":"components/#bounded-contexts","title":"Bounded Contexts","text":"<p>Bounded context can be thought as one service in a larger system.

To cope with these realities, I use a set of recurring patterns in Scalable Modeling that form the foundation for growth-ready scalable systems.</p> <p>I call them the Three Guardians, and together they form the Integrity Chain:</p> <ul> <li>Gatekeeper: the front-line validator that filters commands across consistency boundaries before they reach execution</li> <li>Command Handler: the authoritative validator and executor of state changes inside a single consistency boundary</li> <li>Event Handler: the asynchronous reactor that makes sure all parts of the system catch up after domain facts are published</li> </ul> <p>The chain works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>A command is checked by a Gatekeeper across consistency boundaries</li> <li>If accepted, it is passed to a Command Handler, which validates it synchronously within its own consistency boundary and either executes it or rejects it</li> <li>The Command Handler produces events as facts when state changes occur</li> <li>Event Handlers consume these events and drive reactions across the system</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>Note</p> <p>In addition to the Three Guardians, Scalable Modeling also describes the Query Handler and the Data Aggregator. A Query Handler serves read requests by consulting a single view. A Data Aggregator, on the other hand, combines data from multiple sources or views to maintain derived models. These roles are important but relatively straightforward, so I have not explored them in detail in this post.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/09/14/integrity-chain/#example-ordering-and-archiving-a-product","title":"Example: Ordering and Archiving a Product","text":"<p>Consider a system where customers can order products, but products can also be archived (removed from sale):</p> <ul> <li>A customer issues a command to Order Product X</li> <li>The Gatekeeper checks that Product X exists and forwards the command</li> <li>The Command Handler for the order validates the customer account and records the order if valid</li> <li>The Event Handler later reacts to the OrderPlaced event and updates projections</li> </ul> <p>At the same time, an administrator issues a command to Archive Product X:</p> <ul> <li>The Gatekeeper for product archiving checks for open orders, but due to distribution it may see stale state and allow the archive request to pass</li> <li>The Command Handler archives Product X inside its consistency boundary and emits ProductArchived</li> <li>The Event Handler consumes this event, queries for open orders of Product X and issues compensating actions such as canceling those orders and refunding customers.

They are first-class business features and just as important as the original actions that triggered the need for correction.</p> <p>It is rarely enough to simply delete or undo an operation. In complex domains such as logistics or finance values and states are constantly changing. An order may affect billing, a shipment may alter routing, an invoice may trigger tax reports. If a mistake occurs after one of these actions a dedicated correction process must be triggered. These processes must be explicitly modeled as part of the business domain.</p> <p>Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Billing and payments: A correction flow issues refunds or credit notes rather than silently rolling back the invoice</li> <li>Logistics: A compensating flow reroutes trucks, updates manifests or notifies partners</li> <li>Regulation: A correction flow files a new report rather than erasing the old one</li> </ul> <p>These compensation and correction flows handle the inevitable gaps between feasibility checks and actual execution in distributed systems. They ensure not only technical consistency but also real-world accountability especially in domains where financial or regulatory stakeholders are involved. Ignoring them leads to messy downstream edits and fragile workarounds.</p> <p>In the Integrity Chain Event Handlers are the natural home for modeling such flows since they react asynchronously to established facts and can drive corrective action across boundaries.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/09/14/integrity-chain/#tradeoffs-in-handling-the-archive-order-race","title":"Tradeoffs in Handling the Archive-Order Race","text":"<p>When a product is archived at the same time as new orders are placed, the system must reconcile the conflict. There are several ways to do this, each with different tradeoffs:</p> <ul> <li>Rely on views and compensate later: Archive first, then let an Event Handler query an eventually consistent view of open orders. Once the view has caught up, compensating actions cancel or refund invalid orders. This keeps product and order flows loosely coupled, but reconciliation is delayed and customers may briefly see invalid orders.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Compensate immediately: When a product is archived, there is a short window where new orders may still slip in. If an order attempts to register to a product that has already been archived, the product rejects the registration. When the Event Handler sees this rejection, it issues a compensating action such as canceling the order.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>No single option is universally correct. The choice depends on the domain:</p> <ul> <li>Finance may favor immediate compensation to protect against invalid transactions</li> <li>E-commerce may accept delayed reconciliation for looser coupling and higher throughput</li> <li>Logistics may mix strategies, blocking for some operations while reconciling asynchronously for others</li> </ul> <p>The key is to recognize that compensation, consistency and coupling are all levers. Each domain must strike its own balance.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/09/14/integrity-chain/#why-this-matters","title":"Why This Matters","text":"<p>In a globally distributed system, models such as products, customers and orders exist in multiple places.
