**Domain knowledge is the most underrated key to high development velocity and quality.**

!!! quote

    "It's developer (mis)understanding that's released in production, not the experts' knowledge."

    _**Alberto Brandolini**_

Without a proper understanding of the domain, it's impossible to implement a **conceptual model** that accurately 
reflects it. Effective collaboration with domain experts is essential to bridge this gap. **Events** play a central 
role in uncovering domain insights and fostering a shared language. Additionally, the **immutability of events** 
contributes significantly to scalability, particularly in event-driven architectures.

        "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."

        _**John Gall**_

-   !!! tip

        Design flaws in the simple system tend to compound and lead to exponentially increasing complexity in the complex system.

        "Doing the wrong thing right is not nearly as good as doing the right thing wrong."

        _**Russel L. Ackoff**_

-   !!! tip

        Without a proper understanding of the domain, it's easy to prioritize technical correctness over solving the actual problem.

        "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

        _**Melvin E. Conway**_

-   !!! tip

        Conceptual models derived from the domain often lead to software structures that should mirror the communication structures within the organization.

        "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them."

        _**Alfred North Whitehead**_

-   !!! tip

        When we focus solely on implementing conceptual models from the domain and minimize concerns about technical details, we achieve the highest velocity in problem-solving.
        
        It’s like how modern engineers don’t need to worry about manually managing memory in high-level languages or how mathematicians use symbolic computation tools instead of solving everything by hand. Each layer of abstraction frees us to think bigger and move faster.
