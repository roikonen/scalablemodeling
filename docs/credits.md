## Credits

The following persons have had a lot of influence on what this repository describes:

### Alberto Brandolini
Creator of *Event Storming*, a collaborative workshop technique used to explore and model 
complex business processes through domain events. His approach helps teams rapidly gain insights into business 
domains by focusing on key events that drive processes.

### Eric Evans
Known for pioneering *Domain-Driven Design (DDD)*, a software development philosophy that emphasizes 
aligning the software model closely with the business domain. His work focuses on creating a shared understanding 
between technical teams and domain experts to ensure the software reflects real-world complexity.

### Gregory Young
Renowned for developing and promoting *Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)* and 
*Event Sourcing*. His work centers on separating read and write operations in systems, improving scalability, 
and using event sourcing to maintain the history of all changes in a system, offering resilience and insights 
into past system states.

### Robert C. Martin
Author of *Clean Architecture* and a key figure in the promotion of software craftsmanship. His 
principles focus on building flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems by adhering to the separation of concerns 
and reducing dependencies between different layers of the system. Martin advocates for architecture that allows 
software to evolve over time, ensuring it remains easy to understand, extend, and refactor, even as requirements 
change. His work is centered on creating systems that prioritize independence from frameworks, databases, and UI, 
ensuring longevity and adaptability in software design.

## The Trigger that Led to This
The trigger that led to the creation of this page came from a LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abuijze_the-aggregate-is-great-but-its-time-to-activity-7226485148630843392-gJ_w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Allard Buijze.  
The post was about aggregates and their necessity. I studied the post and ended up watching Sara Pellegrini's and Milan 
Savic's talk: [The Aggregate is dead. Long live the Aggregate!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgigmuHHchI).
After overcoming my cognitive dissonance, I needed to try out the new ideas by drawing them with
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), which led to new ideas that I have collected in this [repository](https://github.com/roikonen/scalablemodeling).

Thanks for triggering the ideas!
