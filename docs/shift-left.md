## Software Engineering Flow

Software is ultimately a **model**, a conceptual solution that, while invisible, solves real-world challenges. 
In software engineering, three aspects are critical:

1. **Understanding**: **WHY** the software is needed and by who (understanding the **purpose** and the **problem**
   it should address).
2. **Designing**: **WHAT** is the **conceptual model** for the solution.
3. **Developing**: **HOW** the solution is **implemented**.

[Scalable Modeling](https://roikonen.github.io/scalablemodeling/) serves as an opinionated bridge from **WHY** to
**HOW**, with a primary focus on the **WHAT**.

Iteration is naturally much cheaper when it is done on the conceptual model rather than on the implementation level.

## Shift Left

[Scalable Modeling](https://roikonen.github.io/scalablemodeling/) is a method for shifting left in the software engineering process. It helps crystallize the **'why'** by focusing on the **'what,'** allowing the creation of a result (the model) that serves as an opinionated bridge to the **'how'**.
